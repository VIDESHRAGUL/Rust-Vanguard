# Number Guessing Game with Cheat and Anti-Cheat

This project demonstrates a simple number-guessing game, accompanied by a cheat tool and an anti-cheat system. The cheat tool attempts to retrieve the secret number from the game's memory, while the anti-cheat system monitors and alerts the user of any unauthorized attempts to access the game's memory.

## Project Structure

- **Game**: A simple number-guessing game where the player must guess a secret number stored in memory.
- **Cheat**: A memory scanner designed to locate and reveal the secret number hidden by the game.
- **Anti-Cheat**: A monitoring tool that detects and alerts the user of any processes attempting to access the game's memory.

## Features

### Game
- Command-line based number-guessing game.
- The secret number is hidden in memory for the player to guess.
  
### Cheat
- Scans the memory of the game process to locate the secret number.
- Utilizes predefined memory signatures to accurately find the secret number.
- Displays the detected number in a pop-up window or on the console.

### Anti-Cheat
- Continuously monitors the game process for any unauthorized memory access.
- Detects and flags processes attempting to manipulate or read the game's memory.
- Alerts the user in real time if a potential cheating attempt is detected.
